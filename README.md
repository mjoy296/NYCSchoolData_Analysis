# NYC School Data Analysis
Final project for Data Science 2: Applied Statistical Languages

Education is a critical part of adolescent growth. However, districts across New York City frequently experience disproportionate funding. In order to evolve, students need to feel engaged in their schoolwork and safe while at school. Unfortunately, not all students have this privilege. Using Linear Regression and KNN, I will examine if having these factors increase the likelihood of good results for students in that school. 

The data is taken from the [2011 NYC School Survey.](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8)
